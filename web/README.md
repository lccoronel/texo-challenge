Develop an interface to make it possible to read the list of nominees and winners
in the Worst Picture category at the Golden Raspberry Awards.

For run this project, follow the steps:
* Clone repo
* Run `npm i`, to install all dependencies
* Run `npm run dev`, to run the project

* If you wanna see the docs, run `npm run storybook`

In the front-end I use react with vite and typescript among other libs

#### Axios

* For HTTP requests

#### Styled components

* To help with styling and some rules in styles

#### Eslint 

* To help with code standardization and readability

### Storybook

* For documentation of global components in the application

obs: I would have liked to have also used JSDOCS as documentation, mainly for global components, but time did not allow me
